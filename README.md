# Work Day Schedule

## Introduction

For this project, we made a work day planner/calendar that is dynamicallt updated and powered with JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. Using these third-party web APIs we created an interactive webpage that allows users to see the current date and time, and slots for hours 9am-5pm to list and save their planned tasks.

## User Interaction Criteria

Users are able to type in the boxes assigned to an hour and save that task to the webpage for later use at a differnt time or day. The text boxes are color coded as well and let the user know whether they are in a current, past, or future time slot. Current is red, future is green,and past time slots are grey. 

## Bonus 🏆
> As a bonus I added a clear input button at the bottom of the page. This way users can quickly clear all localStorage and text content previouslt saved to the page.
